# BT on ROS 2 (spin modified)

Disclaimer: this is made by a complete beginner.

This is a modified version that attempts to include spin action of nav2 into the behaviour tree bt_nav_mememan_interrupt. This code unfortunalty does not work, as it directly ends the behaviour tree without even returning SUCCESS or FAILURE.
